# “Mapping the Global Impact of 2.3.4.4b H5 HPAI: Phylogeography, Extinction Risk, and Societal-Ecological-Economic Consequences.”

# Introduction: 
Only when we understand how infectious diseases evolve and spread, we can develop strategies for disease control while protecting and promoting human and wildlife populations. This knowledge is crucial for designing vaccines, implementing surveillance programs, and controlling their wide-ranging social, ecological, and economic impacts. My research project focuses on an intricate approach to studying infectious diseases, specifically focusing on H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) as a case study. H5 HPAI's recent jump to mammals raises concerns, as most humans lack prior exposure to this variant, underscoring the urgent need to study its spread and potential impact. 

# Aims: 

# Aim 1- Global Phylogeographic Analysis of HPAI: 
This aim focuses on a phylogeographic analysis of high-path avian influenza (HPAI) on a global scale with a focus on seven host categories: pets, wild birds, wild mammals, humans, livestock avian, livestock mammals, and other birds. It will begin by characterizing the levels of sampling and sequencing across different continents to provide a detailed understanding of genetic diversity. Then we continue by identifying source populations where mutations and diverse lineages generate new variations and sink populations where specific strains become dominant. This step helps us trace the movement and spread of the virus. For this, we need to estimate the significant transition rates between locations using the Bayes Factor and conduct a Markov jumps and rewards analysis. This approach will allow us to locate the key origins and destinations of HPAI and understand its transmission dynamics across continents.
# Aim 2 – Math Model: 
This aim is focused on developing a spatially explicit mathematical model to assess the extinction risk of at-risk animals based on the IUCN Red List. The first part of the model is focused on using data such as flyway patterns, poultry trade, cattle migration, and other influences like climate change and genetic diversity to estimate the exposure likelihood of at-risk to infected animals. In other words, this part of the model considers the distribution and the interaction of at-risk and infected animals. The second part of the model uses PhyDyn to assess the extinction risk of at-risk animals upon exposure to infected ones. 
To achieve this, two different categorizations are proposed. The first method categorizes species based on their habitat type—shore, sea, or land. The second method categorizes species based on their level of exposure (ranging from 1 to 5) to other species in an area. The higher their contact and social interaction with other species, the higher their exposure level. This approach will allow us to assess what animals are at risk of becoming extinct because their habitat exposes them to animals infected with HPAI. 
# Aim 3 - Societal, Ecological, and Economic Impacts: 
This aim is a review of the societal, ecological, and economic consequences of HPAI outbreaks and the resulting extinction events. This aim also involves a mathematical model, but this model will assess the broad impacts of these outbreaks on society, ecosystems, and economies. The model will consider various factors, including the loss of biodiversity, disruption of ecological networks, economic losses in the poultry industry, and potential public health risks. The effectiveness of the mathematical model will be evaluated by comparing its predictions with historical outbreak data and assessing its ability to inform and improve mitigation strategies.
# Hypothesis:
-	High-path avian influenza (HPAI) exhibits distinct genetic diversity patterns across geographic locations, with identifiable sources and sinks and significant transition rates between them.
-	Species categorized based on habitat types and/or social interactions will show varying extinction risks due to differential exposure to infected animals and environmental factors.
-	HPAI outbreaks will lead to significant societal impacts, including economic losses in the poultry industry and potential public health risks, alongside disruptions to biodiversity and ecological networks.
-	A comprehensive mathematical model will provide insights into effective strategies for mitigating the societal, ecological, and economic impacts of HPAI outbreaks.
# Research Questions:
-	How does the genetic diversity of high-path avian influenza (HPAI) vary across different geographic locations?
-	What are the primary sources and sinks of HPAI, and what are the significant transition rates between these locations?
-	What are the distinct patterns of extinction risk among species based on their levels of social interaction with infected animals and migration patterns?
-	What are the societal impacts of HPAI outbreaks, particularly in terms of economic losses in the poultry industry and potential public health risks?
-	How do HPAI outbreaks disrupt local biodiversity and ecological networks?
-	How effective are mathematical models in predicting and mitigating the societal, ecological, and economic impacts of HPAI outbreaks?
# Summary:
-	Phylogeographic Analysis of High Path Avian Influenza to identify key origins and destinations while estimating significant transition rates between locations. 
-	Develop a spatially explicit mathematical model to predict extinction risk in endangered species by incorporating cattle movement, bird migration patterns, bird habitat, and poultry trade data. 
-	Analyze the societal, ecological, and economic consequences of HPAI outbreaks.

# Conclusion:
Given the potential for reassortment with human-infecting influenza viruses and the recent spillover of High Path Avian Influenza (HPAI) into cows, it is urgent to study its spread and potential impact. This study will provide insights into the genetic diversity and transmission dynamics of 2.3.4.4b H5 HPAI through phylogeographic analysis, discrete trait analysis, and multiple math modeling. Our findings will highlight the significance of environmental factors and interaction dynamics in disease spread, identifying key sources and sinks of HPAI and assessing varying extinction risks among species. By enhancing our understanding of these dynamics, this study will contribute to efforts aimed at mitigating the societal, economic, and public health impacts of HPAI outbreaks, informing strategies to safeguard both wildlife and human populations against future threats.
